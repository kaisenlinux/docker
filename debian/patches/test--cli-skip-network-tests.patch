Description: cli/command: Skip network tests
 Interestingly, the last time I tried, only the test
 'TestRunBuildFromGitHubSpecialCase' failed,  and it failed only
 for the armel architecture. Which makes absolutely no sense,
 given that it's supposed to fail when there's no network, and
 it should have nothing to do with the architecture.
 .
 Anyway. Let's disable this test.
 .
 Build error below:

 === FAIL: cli/command/image TestRunBuildFromGitHubSpecialCase (0.10s)
 Error: unable to prepare context: unable to 'git clone' to temporary context directory: error fetching: fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/docker/for-win/': Couldn't connect to server
 : exit status 128
     build_test.go:136: assertion failed: expected error to contain "docker-build-git", got "unable to prepare context: unable to 'git clone' to temporary context directory: error fetching: fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/docker/for-win/': Couldn't connect to server\n: exit status 128"
