Comment:
 "~B~" Breaks something (apart from the build).
 "~C~" induce a Circular dependency.
 "~F~" upstream uses an internal Fork.
 "~~"  does not build with system library.
 "~"   not packaged or not available (e.g. removed).
 .
 Thanks to custom repack script, Files-Excluded section is applied to all

 contain too much duplication.
 .
 armon/go-radix v1 causes libnetwork to segfault, cf. #918375
 .
 Temperory vendor etcd library, to upgrade etcd to 3.4 in unstable.
